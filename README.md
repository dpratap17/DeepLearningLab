# DeepLearningLab
This repo contains all the experiment codes as instructed in the Deep Learning Course
Experiment 1:
KEY LEARNINGS:
1. TENSOR CREATION: Understanding multi-dimensional data structures
   - 1D for sequences, 2D for matrices, 3D+ for batches and complex data  
2. OPERATIONS: Mathematical foundations of neural networks
   - Element-wise operations for activation functions
   - Matrix multiplication for layer transformations  
3. INDEXING: Efficient data access and manipulation
   - Boolean masking for conditional operations
   - Advanced indexing for complex data selection   
4. SHAPE MANIPULATION: Preparing data for network architectures
   - Reshape for changing dimensions
   - Squeeze/unsqueeze for dimension management   
5. BROADCASTING: Memory-efficient tensor operations
   - Automatic shape alignment
   - Critical for bias addition and normalization   
6. MEMORY MANAGEMENT: Optimization and safety
   - In-place vs out-of-place trade-offs
   - Memory sharing with views
